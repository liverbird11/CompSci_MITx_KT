## Word game

This simple Python program is created from a problem set (pset4) in the course [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7) by MITx, which I attended from Jan-Mar 2020.

#### Running the code

You can run word game from your chosen IDE (e.g. Spyder) by running _ps4a.py_.

The code will first load words from _words.txt_, and you will be asked to enter _n_ to deal a new hand, _r_ to replay the last hand (if you had run and played at least one game), or _e_ to end game.

You will be dealt a hand with seven letters, and your goal is to construct words from these letters. You score points for each valid word you successfully construct (the points are calculated according to the values attached to letters as in _Scrabble_).
