## Hangman

This simple Python program is created from a problem set (pset3) in the course [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7) by MITx, which I attended from Jan-Mar 2020.

#### Running the code

You can run hangman from your chosen IDE (e.g. Spyder) by running _ps3_hangman.py_.

Alternatively, you may comment out the following last two lines in the Python script, and run these lines in the console each time to start a new game:

```python
secreteWord = chooseWord(wordlist).lower()
hangman(secretWord)
```
